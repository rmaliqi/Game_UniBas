     input --> "$bet$decision$password$" (ex: "51hello") (bet in {1-9}, decision in {0,1} (0 = not attack, 1 = attack) , password is anything) 
    
    * Msg.value when AA_CommitDecision must be equal to bet in "$bet$decision$password$" (ex: "51hello" then msg.value = 5), if these values are not equal then player will not receive refunding nor price
    * Players that not attack also have to place a "lie bet" greater than the minimum in order to influence attackers (it would be returned at the end of the round)
    
    * Sybil attacks allow players to have very high bets (>9) and to add attackers, but they are not incentivized to do this because the high costs and that the win proportional to their bets  
    * Easy improvements: 
        * Allow multiple attacks for each player. This will incentivice cascade or bubble scenarios, and it will be interesting to analyse the strategies of players
